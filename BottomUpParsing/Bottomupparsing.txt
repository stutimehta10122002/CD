SLR is simple LR. It is the smallest class of grammar having few number of states.
SLR is very easy to construct and is similar to LR parsing.
• The only difference between SLR parser and LR(0) parser is that in LR(0) parsing
table, there’s a chance of ‘shift reduced’ conflict because we are entering ‘reduce’
corresponding to all terminal states.
• We can solve this problem by entering ‘reduce’ corresponding to FOLLOW of LHS
of production in the terminating state. This is called SLR(1) collection of items

1.Writing augmented grammar
2. LR(0) collection of items to be found
3. Find FOLLOW of LHS of production
4. Defining 2 functions:goto[list of terminals] and action[list of non-terminals] in the parsing
table
