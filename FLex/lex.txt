Save the above code into a file named lexer.l
Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing lexer.l
Compile the Flex program using the flex command:

flex lexer.l
This command will generate a C file named lex.yy.c.

4. Compile the generated C file using your C compiler (e.g., gcc):

gcc lex.yy.c -o lexer -ll

Run the compiled executable:
bash
Copy code
./lexer
